# Objectives
1. Data understanding and cleaning
2. Perform exploratory data analysis
3. Build ML models to predict sales
4. Evaluate models

# Methods and hypothesis
The key to analytics is data. Sales data were gathered from Big Mart, which is a Grocery Super Market Brand. The data was taken from Kaggle.

### Data understanding and cleaning
Here we loaded the data as a pandas DataFrame, understood the data and handled some missing values. We also identified features that are categorical and those that are numerical.

### EDA
Here we understood the data from a statistical look. Another thing we did was to correlate the columns with our target column and understood the relationship between the more correlated columns. We also did categorical data transformation where we converted the categorical columns to numerical using LabelEncoder(). We generated the below images from the visualization:
